# pixel-cnn++

This is a Python3 / [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) implementation 
of [PixelCNN++](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJrFC6ceg), as described in the following 
paper:

**PixelCNN++: A PixelCNN Implementation with Discretized Logistic Mixture Likelihood and Other Modifications**, by
Tim Salimans, Andrej Karpathy, Xi Chen, Diederik P. Kingma, and Yaroslav Bulatov.

Our work builds on PixelCNNs that were originally proposed in [van der Oord et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328) 
in June 2016. PixelCNNs are a class of powerful generative models with tractable 
likelihood that are also easy to sample from. The core convolutional neural network
computes a probability distribution over a value of one pixel conditioned on the values
of pixels to the left and above it. Below are example samples from a model
trained on CIFAR-10 that achieves **2.92 bits per dimension** (compared to 3.03 of 
the PixelCNN in van der Oord et al.):

Samples from the model (**left**) and samples from a model that is conditioned
on the CIFAR-10 class labels (**right**):

This code supports multi-GPU training of our improved PixelCNN on [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
and [Small ImageNet](http://image-net.org/small/download.php), but is easy to adapt
for additional datasets. Training on a machine with 8 Maxwell TITAN X GPUs achieves
3.0 bits per dimension in about 10 hours and it takes approximately 5 days to converge to 2.92.

## Setup

To run this code you need the following:

- a machine with multiple GPUs
- Python3
- Numpy, TensorFlow and imageio packages:
```
pip install numpy tensorflow-gpu imageio
```

## Training the model

Use the `train.py` script to train the model. To train the default model on 
CIFAR-10 simply use:

```
python3 train.py
```

You might want to at least change the `--data_dir` and `--save_dir` which
point to paths on your system to download the data to (if not available), and
where to save the checkpoints.

**I want to train on fewer GPUs**. To train on fewer GPUs we recommend using `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` 
to narrow the visibility of GPUs to only a few and then run the script. Don't forget to modulate
the flag `--nr_gpu` accordingly.

**I want to train on my own dataset**. Have a look at the `DataLoader` classes
in the `data/` folder. You have to write an analogous data iterator object for
your own dataset and the code should work well from there.

## Pretrained model checkpoint

You can download our pretrained (TensorFlow) model that achieves 2.92 bpd on CIFAR-10 [here](http://alpha.openai.com/pxpp.zip) (656MB).
